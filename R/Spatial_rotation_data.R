#' Observed response accuracy array
#' 
#' This data set contains each subject's observed response accuracy (0/1) at all time points in the Spatial 
#' Rotation Learning Program.
#' @format An array of dimensions N-by-J-by-T. Each slice of the array is an N-by-J matrix, containing the
#' subjects' response accuracy to each item at time point t.

#' Observed response times array
#' 
#' This data set contains the observed latencies of responses of all subjects to all questions in the Spatial Rotation 
#' Learning Program.
#' @format An array of dimensions N-by-J-by-T. Each slice of the array is an N-by-J matrix, containing the
#' subjects' response times in seconds to each item at time point t.

#' Q-matrix
#' 
#' This data set contains the Q matrix of the items in the Spatial Rotation Learning Program.
#' @format A J-by-K matrix, indicating the item-skill relationship.

#' Subjects' test version
#' 
#' This data set contains each subject's test module in the Spatial Rotation Learning Program.
#' @format A vector of length N, containing each subject's assigned test module.
#' @details The data object `"Test_versions"` contains a vector of length N indicating the test module assigned to each subject. 
#' Each test module consists of multiple item blocks with different orders over T time points. 
#' The order of item blocks corresponding to each test module is presented in the data object `"Test_order"`.

#' Test block ordering of each test version
#' 
#' This data set contains the item block ordering corresponding to each test module.
#' @format A T-by-T matrix, each row is the order of item blocks for that test version. 
#' @details Each row represents the test module number and shows the order of item blocks administered to a subject with the test module. 
#' For example, the first row is the order of item block administration (1-2-3-4-5) to subjects with test
#' module 1.
